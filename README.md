# Kidney-stones-from-urine-test-using-Neural-Network
Tensorflow 2.0 was used to predict Kidney Stones from the Urine Test dataset
The data were obtained from
Andrews, D.F. and Herzberg, A.M. (1985) Data: A Collection of Problems from Many Fields for the Student and Research Worker. Springer-Verlag.
or https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/boot/urine.html
Some NaN data points were normalised.

The urine data frame has 79 rows and 7 columns.
79 urine specimens were analyzed in an effort to determine if certain physical characteristics of the urine might be related to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals. Ca Oxalate crystals in other words indirectly indicate the presence of Kidney Stones.

However the dataset is small and may not be suitable for neural network. The model accuracy and loss values are not that great but with more data this can be improved.
